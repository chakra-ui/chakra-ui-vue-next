 *
 * Why does this hook exist?
 *   1. Accessibiliy APIs rely heavily on element IDs
 *   2. Requiring developers to put IDs on every Chakra component
 *      is cumbersome and error-prone.
 *   3. With a components model, we can generate IDs for them!
 *
 * Solutions to ID problem:
 * 1. Generate random IDs
 *    In v0.x of @chakra-ui/vue, we did this for components.
 *    Since then, we've learned some things about performance for
 *    components especially with SSR.
 *
 *    This may not be a good idea because during server rendering
 *    the IDs will be statically generated, and during client-side hydration,
 *    the IDs may not match, when booting up the Vue App. Vue will then
 *    go ahead and recreate the entire application.
 *
 * 2. Don't server render IDs. Instead patch on client `onMounted`
 *    In this approach, generated ID is an empty string on the first render.
 *    This way the client and server possess the same ID.
 *
 *    When the component is finally mounted, we patch the ID.
 *    This may cause a re-render on the client, but it shouldn't be a
 *    big problem, because:
 *
 *        1. Components using `useId` composable are small
 *        2. With solution 1, it would cause a re-render anyway.
 *        3. This patch only runs once. (Only when the `onMounted` life
 *           -cycle hook is called.)
